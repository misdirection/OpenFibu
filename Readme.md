# OpenFibu

> *Doing it all over again*

## Getting Started

1. Checkout the repository

2. Prerequisites
Database
Get a RavenDB server from https://ravendb.net/
 - download the server and install yourself
 - use the docker container from https://ravendb.net/docs/article-page/5.4/csharp/start/installation/running-in-docker-container
 - use the cloud service (there is a free plan)
 - if you use the secure version you have to deal with the certificate. for development i recommend the unsecure installation
 - TODO: missing steps...
If you want to try the app without a database you can use the mocks provided in OpenFibu.Data.Mocks
Register the mock instead of the RavenDb repo in the WPF App.xaml.cs and/or the API startup.cs


3. Profit
